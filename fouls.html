                <p>The game of basketball is a contact sport! There are ten players on the court that are in constant motion - running, jumping, shooting, and moving throughout the entire game. 
basketball clip art, basketball fouls, youth basketball fouls, basketball rules, basketball violations, youth basketball rules, basketball coach, basketball player,</p> 

<p>Because of this constant movement by the players, basketball fouls are often committed. The rules of basketball discourage rough or overly-aggressive play.</p>

<p>The game is meant to be played in a competitive and fun nature -not in a violent way. Therefore, the rules are designed to penalize the players that are playing in an excessively rough manner.</p>

<p>Basketball fouls are called when the official feels there has been physical contact between two players and that one player has gained an advantage because of that contact.</p>

<p>Here are some basic guidelines used by the officials to determine which player has committed the foul after contact has occurred:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first player to become set in a position on the court has the rights to that position.</li>
  <li>When a player moves into the path of an opposing player, obstructs their path, and contact is made - that player is responsible for the contact made.</li>
  <li>A player cannot extend an arm or leg in the pathway of an opponent. When this happens, that player is responsible for the contact made.</li>
  <li>Players have the right to the area extending from their feet, which are set on the floor, up. This is their floor space.</li>
</ul>
<p class="lead">Basketball Fouls - Personal Fouls</p>
<p>The following is a list of the more common fouls committed by players during a game or practice. These fouls are personal fouls that are called against the player initiating contact with an opposing player.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Blocking</strong> - When a player uses their body position to prevent their opponent from advancing.</li>
  <li><strong>Charging</strong> - When an offensive player runs into a defender who has an established position.</li>
  <li><strong>Elbowing</strong> - When a player swings their elbows in an excessive manner and makes contact with their opponent.</li>
  <li><strong>Holding</strong> - Using the hands to interfere with or limit an opponent's freedom of movement.</li>
  <li><strong>Illegal Screen</strong> - The player setting the screen is still moving when the defender makes contact with them. This is a form of blocking which prevents the defender from moving around the screen.</li>
  <li><strong>Hand Check</strong> - When a defender intermittently or continuously uses one or both hands on an opposing player, usually the ball handler.</li>
  <li><strong>Holding</strong> - Using the hands to interfere with or limit an opponent's freedom of movement.</li>
  <li><strong>Over-the-Back</strong> - Jumping on and over the back of an opposing player who is attempting to rebound the basketball.</li>
  <li><strong>Reaching In</strong> - When attempting to steal the basketball, the defender extends their arm and hand and makes contact with the ballhandler.</li>
  <li><strong>Tripping</strong> - When a player uses their foot or leg to cause their opponent to fall or loose their balance.</li>
</ul>
<p class="lead">Other Common Basketball Fouls</p>
<p>The following list is some of the other common fouls that are committed during a game or practice.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Flagrant Foul</strong> - A foul committed in an violent and harmful manner.</li>
  <li><strong>Intentional Foul</strong> - A foul committed on purpose, usually by a defensive player, to stop the clock or prevent a basket.</li>
  <li><strong>Shooting Foul</strong> - When a defender makes contact with an offensive player who is in the act of shooting the basketball.</li>
  <li><strong>Technical Foul</strong> - Violations and misconduct that are detrimental to the game. These are penalized by free-throw opportunities</li>
</ul>
<p class="lead">Basketball Fouls And Consequences</p>
<p>Every basketball foul that is committed has a specific consequence or punishment for the player and team committing the foul. The following list outlines the specific consequence for each type of foul.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Flagrant Foul</strong> - Two free throws, possession of the basketball out of bounds, and the player committing the foul is disqualified.</li>
  <li><strong>Intentional Foul</strong> - Two free throws and possession of the basketball out of bounds.</li>
  <li><strong>Personal Foul</strong> - Possession of the basketball out of bounds. One-and-one free throw situation if the team is above their foul limit.</li>
  <li><strong>Shooting Foul</strong> - Two or three free throws depending on the type of shot taken.</li>
  <li><strong>Technical Foul</strong> - Two free throws and possession of the basketball out of bounds.</li>
</ul>
