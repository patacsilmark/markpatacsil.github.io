                <p>In basketball, a violation is the most minor class of illegal action. Most violations are committed by the team with possession of the ball, when a player mishandles the ball or makes an illegal move. The typical penalty for a violation is loss of the ball to the other team. This is one type of turnover.</p> 

<p>Here is a list and description of non-foul violations in the game of basketball. The penalty for most violations is loss of possession of the ball.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Travelling</strong> - One of the basic ideas of the sport of basketball is that you have to dribble or bounce the ball while you are walking or running. When you have stopped dribbling one of your feet will become your pivot foot. You cannot move your pivot foot or lift it off of the ground. If you do, this is called traveling.</li>
  <li><strong>Double Dribble</strong> - You only get to dribble once in basketball. If you stop dribbling you have to pass it to another player or shoot the ball. If you start dribbling again, this is called double dribbling.</li>
  <li><strong>Three Seconds</strong> - Offensive players are not allowed to stay in the free throw lane, or key, for more than three seconds. Anytime they leave the key or the ball hits the rim, the three second count starts over again.</li>
  <li><strong>Eight Seconds</strong> - The offensive team has 8 seconds to get the ball across half court. If it takes longer than 8 seconds, then they will lose possession of the ball</li>
  <li><strong>Over-and-back</strong> - Once the offensive team has gotten the ball over half court, they cannot go back into the defender's half court with the ball. This is called over-and-back.</li>
  <li><strong>Carrying</strong> - Carrying, or palming, is like a double dribble. Players may not put the palm of their hands under the ball or carry the ball in one hand for a long time. This is similar to holding the ball and a double dribble.</li>
  <li><strong>Lane Violations</strong> - During a free throw shot, players will line up on both sides of the lane. If they jump into the lane prior to the shot, it will be called a lane violation. If it was an offensive player, a made shot will not count. If it was a defensive player, a missed shot will not count and the shooter will get another try.</li>
  <li><strong>Kicking</strong> - Players are not allowed to intentionally kick the ball. If a defensive player kicks the ball, the offensive team will get it out of bounds.</li>
  <li><strong>Goaltending</strong> - Goaltending is when a player interferes with a shot when it is above the rim, but still on its downward path to the basket, interferes with the ball while on the rim of the basket, or touches the net or rime while the ball is being shot. If goaltending is called on the defense, the shot is called good. If goaltending is on the offense, then the shot does not count and the defense gets the ball.</li>
  <li><strong>Out of bounds</strong> - The ball is considered out of bounds when it touches the ground outside the lines of the court. The lines themselves are considered out of bounds as well. It is also out of bounds if the ball touches a player who has any part of their body touching the ground out of bounds. </li>
