                <ul>
                <li>James Naismith, a teacher at a YMCA in Springfield, Massachusetts, is credited with inventing basketball in 1891.</li>
                <li>The first “hoops” were actually just peach baskets and the first backboards were made of wire.</li>
                <li>The game became an official Olympic event at the Summer Games in Berlin, Germany in 1936.</li>
                <li>Two leagues called the National Basketball League (NBL) and the Basketball Association of America (BAA) merged after the 1948-49 season to become today's National Basketball Association (NBA).</li>
                <li>The Boston Celtics have won the most NBA championships (17), including seven straight from 1960 to 1966.</li>
                <li>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who played 20 seasons in the NBA, holds the record for most points scored in a career with 38,387.</li>
                <li>On March 2, 1962, Philadelphia center Wilt Chamberlain scored 100 points in one game against New York. That is the most one player has ever scored in one game.</li>

                <li>The NBA instituted the three-pointer before the 1979-80 season, an idea it borrowed from the ABA.</li>
